# Gesture-Controlled-Home-Automation
This IoT-based smart home automation system integrates NodeMCU, Blynk, and Python OpenCV to enable efficient control of appliances. Users can manage up to four devices via the Blynk app, with real-time status updates. Gesture control, powered by Python OpenCV, introduces an intuitive interaction layer, allowing users to operate appliances like lights and fans through hand movements.

Gesture recognition leverages a webcam and Python OpenCV to detect hand landmarks and count raised fingers, translating these gestures into commands. For instance, raising one finger might turn on a light, while raising two could control a fan. The process ensures seamless communication with the NodeMCU, which triggers relays accordingly. The system uses MediaPipe for reliable hand tracking and precise finger counting, ensuring accuracy in gesture detection.

The efficiency of gesture control lies in its contact-free operation and adaptability. It minimizes the need for physical buttons, making the system hygienic and ideal for situations requiring hands-free interaction. Adjustments in the OpenCV code optimize accuracy, ensuring gestures are correctly interpreted even in varying lighting conditions.

However, the system is dependent on stable Wi-Fi and consistent gesture recognition performance, which may be affected by environmental factors like poor lighting or occlusions. Despite these limitations, the integration of gesture control enhances the system's overall functionality, offering an innovative, user-friendly, and scalable solution for modern home automation.
